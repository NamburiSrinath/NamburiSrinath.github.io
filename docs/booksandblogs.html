<h4>Author: Richard P. Feynman</h4>
<h4>Read on: March 2021</h4>
<p>Well&hellip;most of us know Richard Feynman as one of the world's famous physicist. And a few might have heard about &ldquo;Feynman technique&rdquo; when learning a new concept which roughly goes like this &ldquo;You can vouch that you understood a concept only if you can explain it to a 7 yr old kid and the kid can understand it perfectly&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book shows the other shades of Feynman. Before reading this, I thought Feynman is a studious fellow who just delves in books and equations. But this gives an entirely new picture of this guy I believe <b>lived his life to the fullest</b> He entertains not just himself but everyone who's with him with his sarcasm, idiosyncratic nature and stubbornness. A party guy, who visits bars frequently (and presumably do physics while enjoying), learns new skills (such as playing drums, learning Japanese, Portuguese, painting) to entertain himself himself and get satisfied while he travels across the world (to give lectures).</p>
<p>There are few incidents in this book which makes us laugh at how childish he behaves at others (though his stubbornness is altogether the next level) such as</p>
<p>1. For a particular trip, the manager asks to produce tickets to reimburse the amount. Feynman says he won't give tickets because you have to trust on what he say instead of some paper. Finally, he doesn't get his reimbursement and continues not to produce tickets</p>
<p>2. For a particular contract, he says he'll only sign at 13 places. But the entire contract has 14 signatures with the last one being his paycheque. Still he doesn't sign on that</p>
<p>And there are lot of other incidents which I am sure will make us laugh. Some of them made me think &ldquo;Is he really the Nobel laureate?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Author: Alex Michaelides</h4>
<h4>Read on: Feb 2021</h4>
<p>Usually, I read a book slowly, to grasp details and feel it. But this one, I felt anxious to reach till the end and probably that made this book my fastest fiction read. The suspense carried till the end was just amazing. The way the author unravels the facts at the last 10-20 pages literally makes one jump out of the seat.</p>

<h4>Author: Amor Towles</h4>
<h4>Read on: Feb 2021</h4>
<p>Highly relatable to present scenario. Can't specifically classify as fiction. It's a mixture of poetry, fiction, (contemporary as well) and towards the end a bit suspense (which was actually unexpected)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if you were house arrested for a couple of months?&rdquo; - We had experienced it via lockdown in 2020. And the good thing is, we have internet, TV etc to pass time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if someone is house arrested in a hotel for the rest of their life? And the moment that person steps out of the hotel, he/she will be killed&rdquo;. This was the premise of the novel.</p>

<h4>Author: Neil deGrasse Tyson</h4>
<h4>Read on: Jan 2021</h4>
<p>First time I've known about Neil deGrasse Tyson in few TV series as a guest appearence (Big Bang Theory, Brooklyn 99). That's how I searched and got across this book. It's a very small yet powerful book which walks us through some beauties in the universe. As the author mentions in his book (abridged)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This book provides you just the right amount of information so your lunch time conversations might be serious sometimes but not so much to get confused&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, Neil deGrasse Tyson had done a great job. He explains topics such as</p>
<ol>
<li><p>DarkMatter: How it was discovered</p>
</li>
<li><p>DarkEnergy: What's the reason we had to discover this</p>
</li>
<li><p>Search for Exoplanets: How close we are to our distant neighbours and how's the quest going</p>
</li>
<li><p>Periodic table in the universe: Describing elements from the perspective of an astrophysicist</p>
</li>
<li><p>Big Bang theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>Anthropocentric nature of us and how we need to look at the bigger picture. (The eg where he says, we are drinking the urine of Archimedes or breathing the air of Napolean Bonaparte should make us a little less anthropocentric)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>with precise information.</p>
<p>Though it's not very easy for general audience to understand all the technicalites in the book (especially the initial few chapters), I believe this is the best that a non-tech/non-science can start off with to understand about ourselves (when I mean ourselves, I mean the entire universe). </p>

<div id="text-container"><h2>Sapiens: A brief history of humankind</h2>
<h4>Author: Yuval Noah Harari</h4>
<h4>Read on: Jan 2021</h4>
<p>As an already acclaimed book, this carries pretty intense, well detailed stuff about us. It's as if one has looked on Earth for past 13 billion years and summarized it. Books like this are hard to summarize/review in detail because every couple of pages offers something. But a few of them are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How Agricultural Revolution is not good for humans Yes!! I was shocked after reading the author's perspective, with evidences because I believed Agricultural Revolution is something we created to make us more relaxed, comforting and happy. But it turns out ever since then, we began working too hard, anxious, troubled and more suffering than ever</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Inter-related reality, imagined myths i.e how we assign value to money, religion, things, stocks, properties (tangible or intangible, still)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Philosophical thoughts into the meaning of life, death etc. One eg to quote is about Buddhism which says suffering or happiness is present inside us because we crave for one to exist and other to vanish. Instead, it's better to pass each and every feeling without worrying about whether it will persist to continue or not</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>How we are creating havoc to ecosystem for our own greed. Population of many animals depleted and became extinct within a couple of centuries once humans started colonizing unknown places. And our own greed is causing many animals including chickens, cows, pigs etc; to suffer hell on Earth</p>
</li>

<h4>Author: Edwin Lefevre</h4>
<h4>Read on: Dec 2020</h4>
<p>It's a very niche book. This is about the journey of Larry Livingstone, a common man who started as a board boy and turned to a millionaire in the US stock market in the early 1900s. He makes and loses millions of dollars couple of times and this book is like a journal describing his journey, his mistakes and lessons learnt.</p>
<p>Though the market changed a lot in the last century, the basic principles described via his anecdotes are still sound. Few noteworthy mentions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Tips</b> - How we get influenced by outside information (it might be legit, still the sole decision should be made by the person)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Manipulations</b> - How people with large sums of money can manipulate market
At few places, we can relate it to Harshad Mehta's scam of 1992</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Ignorance, Hope, Greed, Fear</b> - We hold a stock even if it delivers losses for a long time hoping one day tables turn and we will get profits. And we sell a stock as soon as we get a small profit fearing that it might fall down (so internally feeling to have atleast this profit)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> This point is not valid for value investors or for that matter investors who look at the long run. Overall, this book is more suitable for traders.</p>

<h4>Author: Dan Ariely</h4>
<h4>Read on: Nov 2020</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Why did you end up taking a year membership to that gym where a 6 months might be enough?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Might feel okay when we steal an item from a shop (or grab extra pens from office) but feel guilty when we steal cash</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commit ourselves that we will reduce 10kgs or read 100 books by the end of the year but couldn't even reach half the goal</p>
</li>
<li><p>How a 5 dollar medicine couldn't cure but a 50 dollar one's does miraculously?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Believes that while buying we should get for the lowest possible price and while selling we should get for the highest possible price</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We make irrational decisions and we all know that. But only some of us know that those decisions are predictable, repeatable and can be changed (not easily though). This book by Dan Ariely explores on some of those irrational decisions we make and how we can do better by simply listening to ourselves before deciding. Do read this book to understand how human behavior works and how we can be the real owners of our decisions where author demonstrates with a series of experiments</p>

<h4>Author: Gail Honeyman</h4>
<h4>Read on: Oct 2020</h4>
<p>This book is for someone who feels they are mentally depressed, has a lot of emotional difficulties and buried their emotions very deep, can't open up to society. The only way to survive is to open up, express it to someone whom you believe instead of suppressing as the ones which are suppressed only rebounds and the life become difficult.</p>
<p>Eleanor Oliphant is a 30-sh woman in Glasgow, whose life is pretty simple (and maybe considered as boring at the start but not actually) i.e cycle of work and sleep with a rigid, planned timetable. But she has a scarred past and the rest of the story uncovers what it is and how she feels about it, opens herself up. </p>

<h4>Author: Oliver Sacks</h4>
<h4>Read on: Oct 2020</h4>
<p>This book deals with the extreme bizarre neurological cases observed by Dr. Oliver Sacks in the 19th century. He claims that every case needs to be treated separately because some patients would like to have a disease (yes, it may sound strange but read it) rather than getting cured while some patients feel bad after it's cured etc; It's a bit technical and somewhat difficult to follow for a normal reader so choose accordingly after reading the review.</p>
<p><b>Have you ever felt that a disease is something that just destroys the person i.e the affected will be unhappy for the rest of their life?</b></p>
<p>If you think it's a YES, definitely read this book to know why you might not be correct. If you say it's a NO (means you already know few people with some peculiar diseases who lead happy life), then maybe this adds new perspective and lots of extra information. (I am not supporting that it's good to have a disease but their cases teach a lot about life) </p>

<p>Suppose you are a highly successful, respected person in your field and there's no one to stop you from your dreams. But one day, you came to know that you are going to die.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What's your reaction?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What about Family, friends, successful career etc. For whom will you give more importance?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Will you choose a PAINFUL EXPERIENCE BUT EXTENDING LIFE FOR A SHORT DURATION or a SILENT BUT INSTANT DEATH? </p>
</li>
<li><p>Now suppose, your partner or very close acquaintance is in death bed and the doctor asked you to choose whether to proceed with PAINFUL EXPERIENCE BUT EXTENDING LIFE or a SILENT DEATH. What will you choose now?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously there is no one-answer-for-all. Thinking about death is very uncomfortable but trust me, books like this prove that it's necessary.</p>

<li><p>Most of us always think that <i>&ldquo;This is out of my scope, I cant do anything, because it's GENES&rdquo;</i> when it comes to obesity, height, color, diseases etc; Is it true? Is heredity all about genes passing from parents from offspring (By now, you might guess it as NOT, but what else is there).</p>

<h4>Read on: May 2020</h4>
<p>It's such an emotional story of Marie Laure (a blind girl) and Werner (an orphan) and the book is an absolute page-turner. The author used psychological tactics and made each chapter constrained to 1-2 pages so that reader is intact and he changed the narration in multiple timelines (Something similar to Nolan's technique in movies). The author made a gripping and heart touching fiction connecting radio, some magical stone, an orphan and a blind girl.</p>

<h4>Read on: May 2020</h4>
<p>Whenever you look at the stories of successful companies, it is exciting to see how the founders are highly passionate towards their dreams. While most of us are aware of the anecdotes like <i>“college-dropout-making-computers” (Microsoft)</i> or <i>“connectivity-from-dorms” (Facebook)</i>, we might not have heard the stories of other companies. Phil Knight, made an attempt to share his journey in creating Nike with his memoir, “Shoe dog”. It’s heart touching, a fascinating journey and has philosophical aspects. His life (or maybe his narration) is somewhat cinematic where the protagonist explores the world, takes risks, has ups and downs and finally builds this huge empire that we see today.</p>

<p>We all have few questions in our mind such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Does God really exist?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If so, why did he create this universe? And humankind with all these miseries in the world?</p>

<h4>Authors: Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths</h4>
<h4>Read on: Nov 2019</h4>
<p>I came to Bangalore (India) in Aug 2019 and within a few days, the first problem I faced was <i>“To search a room”</i>. The company gave a week to search and settle down. Luckily, I found a good place to stay near the office within 2 days. But a small question came to my mind, <b>“For how long should I need to search to secure a room, given the competition for PGs or flats?”</b> — Is there any safe way to search and secure a good room?
Within a couple of months, I found the answer (or a mathematical explanation) for this question. (though it was accidentally by reading this book!)</p>
<p>Have you ever felt like <b>“What’s the use of this?”</b> or <b>“Where can I apply this practically?”</b> (when studying a particular theory). This book offers excellent applications of how computer science algorithms (or mathematics) can be applied to our daily world problems and improve our decision-making skills.</p>
